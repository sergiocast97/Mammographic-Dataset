# Mammographic Dataset

This is my take on the Mammographic Dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass for Machine Learning Algorithms.
In it, the coursework is divided in the following stages.

- Data Exploration and Visualization
- Modelling, using train/test partitions and Logistic Regression
- Improvement, using Cross Validation and Random Forest
